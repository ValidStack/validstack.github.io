#contribution
Our task was to develop a dashboard with graphs that would show
various metrics, such as which room is the busiest, the number of
empty and occupied tables, and so on.
- • Developed reusable chart components
- • Created an interactive dashboard
- • Harmonized the appearance with the mock-ups
provided by the design team
